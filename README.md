# Pre-work - Task.Controll

Task.Controll is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: Đặng Nhật Thiên

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following required functionality is completed:

* [x] User can successfully add and remove items from the todo list
* [x] User can tap "EDIT" button and bring up an edit screen for the todo item and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [x] User can persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following optional features are implemented:

* [x] Persist the todo items into SQLite instead of a text file
* [x] Improve style of the todo items in the list using a custom adapter
* [x] Add support for completion due dates for todo items
* [x] Use a DialogFragment instead of new Activity for editing items
* [x] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [x] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
- Can't touch multiple views on a listview item.
- New with SQLite.
- New with DialogFragment.
- Scroll listview not smoothly.

But I have overcomed all of them.
